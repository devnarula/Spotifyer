An automatic spotify music playlist converter from youtube playlist upon user request

The main file is called app.js that uses node.js to authenticate the user with the Spotify API in real time.
Next, it retrieves the required API data using Ajax HTTP Requests.
Lastly, using Node JS Promises, it performs a series of asynchronous requests to POST music data in the specified playlist retrieved from youtube.
